# Week 5 - Frontier Technologies

In this final week of the curriculum, we would like to introduce you to some exciting topics and tools at the forefront of programmable cryptography.

First, we will dive into some basics about MPC/FHE. Then we will look at some interesting tools and primitives like TLSNotary and ZKEmail.

Keep in mind that the topics in this module continue to evolve at a rapid pace. We will only be able to touch on some basic concepts and the rest will be for you to explore.

## MPC/FHE

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) are all areas of research that have significant overlap with each other. So far, you have mostly focused on ZKPs, but learning about MPC/FHE will allow you to see things from a new perspective.

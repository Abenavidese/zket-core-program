# Week 3 - Hack and Experiment

## ZKET Core Program Hackathon Ecuador üá™üá®: Building a More Private and Verifiable Future

Welcome, builders, innovators, and pioneers! We are thrilled to invite you to the ZKET Hackathon Ecuador, a unique opportunity to dive into the world of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography. This revolutionary technology is reshaping the future of privacy, security, and digital trust.

Over the program weeks, you learned from experts, collaborated with peers, and built innovative solutions to real-world problems. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting your journey into Web3, this hackathon is for you. Let's build a more private, transparent, and equitable future for Ecuador and the world. üöÄ

## üìú Guiding Principles

**Code for Impact**: Your code doesn't have to be perfect, but it should be a functional prototype that is presentable and runnable. Focus on a core idea that can have a real-world impact.

**Collaborate and Learn**: Don't reinvent the wheel. Use existing libraries and tools to accelerate your development. This is a learning experience, so don't be afraid to ask for help from mentors, but always try to solve problems on your own first.

**Communicate Your Vision**: Be prepared to present your project clearly and concisely. Explain the problem you are solving, how your solution works, and the potential impact it can have. Your ability to communicate your vision is as important as your code.

## üìÖ Hackathon Schedule

**Week 0-2: Learn & Ideate**
- Introductory workshops on Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Circom, and Noir.
- Team formation and brainstorming sessions focused on local challenges.

**Week 3: Build & Develop**
- Coding sessions.
- Mid-point check-ins and peer feedback sessions.
- Finalize your project and prepare your presentation.
- Submission Deadline: Oct, 21th

## üèÜ Judging Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Technical Innovation (30%)**: How novel and creative is your use of ZK technology?
- **Impact & Relevance (30%)**: Does your project solve a meaningful problem?
- **Execution (20%)**: Is your project a functional prototype? Is the code well-structured and runnable?
- **Presentation (20%)**: How clearly and effectively do you communicate your project's vision and functionality?

## üí° Hackathon Tracks & Project Wishlist

We've designed several tracks to inspire your creativity. Here are some ideas to get you started, with a special focus on challenges and opportunities in Ecuador:

### Track 1: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) for Inclusion üí∏

**The Challenge**: A significant portion of Ecuador's population, particularly in rural and indigenous communities, remains unbanked. How can we build more inclusive and private financial systems?

- **Private Microlending**: Design a ZK-powered platform that allows individuals to prove their creditworthiness (e.g., consistent rent payments, utility bills) without revealing their entire financial history, enabling access to microloans.

- **Anonymous Savings Pools ("Cajas de Ahorro")**: Create a digital version of traditional community savings pools. Members can prove they've made their contributions without revealing their identity or total savings, enhancing trust and security.

### Track 2: Digital Identity & Reputation üõ°Ô∏è

**The Challenge**: Ecuador has faced significant challenges with the security and privacy of its digital identity system, leading to data breaches and a lack of public trust. How can we empower citizens with more control over their personal data?

- **Self-Sovereign Digital ID**: Build a ZK-based digital identity system that allows users to selectively disclose information about themselves (e.g., proving they are over 18 for online services without revealing their exact date of birth or C√©dula number).

- **Private Professional Credentials**: Create a platform where professionals can prove their qualifications (e.g., university degrees from SENESCYT, certifications) without revealing their full identity, combating fraud and protecting privacy.

- **Reputation System for the Informal Economy**: Develop a system that allows workers in the informal economy (artisans, freelance workers) to build a verifiable reputation based on their skills and reliability, without a centralized authority.

### Track 3: Public Goods & Transparent Supply Chains üçåüç´

**The Challenge**: Ensuring the transparency and fairness of Ecuador's key export supply chains (bananas, cocoa, gold) and public services is a major challenge. How can we bring more trust and accountability?

- **Fair-Trade Cocoa & Banana Tracker**: Build a ZK-powered system that allows consumers to scan a QR code on a product and verify that it was sourced ethically and sustainably, without revealing sensitive business data of small farmers.

- **"Mina Justa" Gold Certification**: Design a platform that uses ZKPs to certify that gold was mined without forced labor or environmental damage, enhancing the value and reputation of Ecuadorian gold.

- **Transparent Public Procurement**: Create a system that uses ZKPs to verify that public contracts are awarded fairly and without corruption, while protecting the privacy of the bidders.

### Track 4: Secure & Verifiable Governance üó≥Ô∏è

**The Challenge**: The recent "failed experience" with the telematic vote for overseas Ecuadorians has highlighted the need for more secure and trustworthy voting systems. How can we use ZK to enhance democratic processes?

- **End-to-End Verifiable E-Voting**: Develop a ZK-based electronic voting system that allows citizens to verify that their vote was cast and counted correctly, without revealing how they voted.

- **Anonymous Whistleblower Platform**: Build a secure platform that allows citizens to report corruption or misconduct without revealing their identity, using ZKPs to verify the authenticity of their claims.

- **Decentralized Community Polling ("Consulta Popular")**: Create a tool that enables local communities to conduct secure and private polls on important issues, fostering greater civic engagement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Resources & Toolkits

To help you get started, we've compiled a list of beginner-friendly ZK toolkits and resources. We encourage you to explore their documentation and tutorials.

**Noir**: A Rust-based language for creating and verifying zero-knowledge proofs. It's designed to be developer-friendly and is a great starting point for ZK development.
- [Noir Documentation](https://noir-lang.org/docs)
- [Awesome Noir](https://github.com/noir-lang/awesome-noir)

**Circom & SnarkJS**: The most widely used language for writing ZK circuits. It has a large community and a rich ecosystem of tools.
- [Circom Documentation](https://docs.circom.io/)
- [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs)

**zk-kit**: A set of libraries and utilities for building ZK applications, including semaphore for anonymous signaling.
- [zk-kit Documentation](https://zkkit.org/)
- [Semaphore Documentation](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/guides/proofs)

We are incredibly excited to see what you will build. This is your chance to push the boundaries of what's possible with ZK technology and create solutions that can make a real difference in Ecuador.

**¬°Vamos a construir el futuro!**
